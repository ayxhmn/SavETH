### Goal based micro-savings dapp!

1. User defines a savings goal (for example, saving certain amount of money for a laptop).
2. User deposits money in small amounts into the savings vault contract against this goal over time.
3. Funds are only released to the users' wallet after the savings goal (enough funds have been saved for the purpose of buying the laptop) is reached.
4. Users can define multiple goals.

(Savings vault contract -> Users -> Goals -> Funds)  
Savings vault contract:
- User 1
    - Goal 1 (laptop): 0.8 ETH saved (target: 2.5 ETH)
    - Goal 2 (bag): 0.0001 ETH saved (target: 0.005 ETH)
- User 2
    - Goal 1 (car): 5 ETH saved (target: 15 ETH)
    - Goal 2 (microwave oven): 0.5 ETH saved (target: 0.5 ETH, released)
- so on...
