## 🪙 What is SavETH?

A decentralized savings vault where users define savings goals (like saving for a laptop or a vacation), deposit small amounts of ETH over time, and withdraw only once the goal is fully funded.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works:

1. 🎯 User creates a savings goal (e.g., "Buy MacBook – 2 ETH").
2. 💸 User deposits funds into that goal whenever they want.
3. 🔒 Funds are **locked** until the goal is fully funded.
4. 🔑 Once the target is reached, user can withdraw.

## 📊 Example (On-chain Storage):

```javascript
SavingsVault Contract  
├── User 1  
│   ├── Goal 0: "Laptop" – 0.8 / 2.5 ETH saved  
│   └── Goal 1: "Bag" – 0.0001 / 0.005 ETH saved  
├── User 2  
│   ├── Goal 0: "Car" – 5 / 15 ETH saved  
│   └── Goal 1: "Microwave" – 0.5 / 0.5 ETH saved ✅ (Withdrawable)
```
